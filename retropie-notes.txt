Ok, all should be installed, but before you can actually use disk images, you need to edit the /etc/emulationstation/es_systems.cfg file.

The command is.

sudo nano /etc/emulationstation/es_systems.cfg



Change the apple2 section from this..

  <system>
    <name>apple2</name>
    <fullname>Apple II</fullname>
    <path>/home/pi/RetroPie/roms/apple2</path>
    <extension>.sh .SH</extension>
    <command>/opt/retropie/supplementary/runcommand/runcommand.sh 0 _SYS_ apple2 %ROM%</command>
    <platform>apple2</platform>
    <theme>apple2</theme>
    <directlaunch/>
  </system>


to this..

  <system>
    <name>apple2</name>
    <fullname>Apple II</fullname>
    <path>/home/pi/RetroPie/roms/apple2</path>
    <extension>.dsk .nib .po .DSK .NIB .PO .do .DO</extension>
    <command>/opt/retropie/supplementary/runcommand/runcommand.sh 0 _SYS_ apple2 %ROM%</command>
    <platform>apple2</platform>
    <theme>apple2</theme>
    <directlaunch/>
  </system>


== Dispmanx and video aspect ratio

Dispmanx is used to scale the emulator's video output to fullscreen,
which stretches the video frame to fit the display in both dimensions.
On HD and other 16:9 displays, video will be horizontally stretched.

If you want aspect-corrected video, an alternative method to
fill the display vertically is to set "Screen Height" to your
display's vertical resolution and then set "Screen Width" to 1.33
times the height. On a 1920x1080 HD display, this would be

  Screen Width  = 1440
  Screen Height = 1080

Make this change in /opt/retropie/configs/apple2/linapple.conf .
Then, to defeat the fill scaling that `dispmanx` does, remove linapple
from the list of dispmanx platforms. For you textfile editors, that's
in /opt/retropie/configs/all/dispmanx.cfg.
