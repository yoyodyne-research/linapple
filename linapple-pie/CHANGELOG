Linapple-pie v2b.1
++Added searching for linapple.conf and Master.dsk in the ~/.linapple directory first, if not found look in the start directory.
!!Fix crashes when linapple.conf and Master.dsk could not be found.
++Added the -r arg, to autoboot from command line use this in addition to the -1 command.
++Added -2 to mount the second drive.
!!Moved the -b benchmark option to the same sub as the other args.
--Figured out that the program has always been keyboard only, so disabling the mouse for framebuffer users was a no brainer.



Linapple-pie
Forked from linapple2b source.

Added the use of the SDL_image library to move the font,splash, and charset40 graphics files internally.
Added a -1 command line switch to mount and run a dsk image automatically.
Turned of the SDL cursor, so keyboard only folks.



For LinApple version 2b has been made:
!! Fixed gcc version 4.8.4 <unistd.h> includes
!! Some cleanup on Makefile, INSTALL, README and some others

For LinApple version 2.0 has been made:
!! Fixed screen corruption bug for x64 systems
!! Fixed gcc 4.4 compilation error lacking <strings>
++ FTP support. You can load disk images on Slots 6 (1 & 2) and Hard disks images, using FTP server such as apple.asimov.net
	Press Alt+F3, Alt+Shift+F3 for load disk image through FTP
++ Screen sizes are now flexible. You can set any screen size you wish, just be catious - not all screen sizes can work in full screen mode
++ .zip images support for FDD 140K (in read-only mode). Just first file in .zip archive will be read and inserted as an image.
	You can load .zip images directly from your file system (by F3/F4 keypress), or from FTP server (by pressing ALT+F3(F4)).
-- Sound is still glitched. Needs repairing.  Please help!

For LinApple version 1.1 has been added:
++ 1. Opening of compressed .gz files - in read-only mode. Works only for FDD 140Kb drives.
++ 2. Super quick load-save states (CTRL+0..9 - quick load state, CTRL+SHIFT+0..9 - quick save it) in current states directory.
++ 3. Add Mockingboard (but not Phasor??) support, without speech, as I could take it.
	But Mockingboard works! You may test it in such games as Berzap! (you need to switch Mockingboard on after pressing Ctrl+C in the game), in Willy Byte in  the Digital Dimensions, in Pitfall II(tm), in UltimaIV and few others.
++ 4. VideoBenchmark added! Run `linapple -b' to see benchmark running and its result in console.
++ 5. Parallel Printer file name can be set in linapple.conf (default was Printer.txt in working directory)
